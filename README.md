****Hi there!****

I'm Ariq, a newbie developer based in Sarawak, Malaysia.

I design and build anything that I feel and want to try.

If i see any ideas or anything that pops in my mind maybe i will try develop it my way.

I've got some projects that I pinned, and more soon to come.

Maybe i'll start bulding my repo more often or not?

**Fun Facts:**
I am lazy person, but sometimes my laziness can bring a lot of things to the table hehe.
