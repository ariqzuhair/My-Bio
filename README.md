👋 Hello, my name is Ariq

🎓 Soon to be graduating from Diploma in Computer Science Information Technology (June 2022)

🏡 Living in Kuching, Sarawak.

📚 I have build some projects with a main role as a FRONT-END developer during my studies. I would like 
      to create my own projects to increase my portfolio and gaining more experience in the process.

💻 I hope in the future that I would become a successful FRONT-END developer with the title of SENIOR 
      WEB DEVELOPER and could land a job in a big company to pursue their goals and to chase my dreams.

⛺ During my free time, I like to destress myself with games and doing some workout activity to keep my 
      body in shape.
